Author: Andrii Veretynskyi

Date: Aug 6 2025

Abstract
Goodsluck is a community-driven marketplace that integrates micro-contributions toward item purchases with randomized contributor selection for deal closure rights, while incorporating reward tokens, profit redistribution, and a community jury system. The platform gamifies e-commerce without constituting gambling by ensuring legal compliance through no-purchase-necessary (NPN) options and transparent, fair mechanisms.

Description

Purpose
Goodsluck aims to create a marketplace where buyers contribute micro-shares towards goods, and contributors receive randomized opportunities to close deals or earn rewards. The system promotes fairness, transparency, and community engagement, avoiding gambling classification by incorporating NPN compliance and reward tokens that cannot be bought with fiat.

Key Components & Features
Marketplace Core
Sellers list goods with fixed prices.
Buyers contribute micro-payments ("shares") representing pennies toward items.
Upon reaching full price, one contributor is randomly selected to close the deal and receive the item.

No Purchase Necessary (NPN) Compliance
Each item includes a legally compliant NPN alternative entry method, such as submission of a form or creative task.
NPN entries grant the same chance shares as monetary contributions.
The system enforces rules ensuring fairness and eligibility.

Randomized Contributor Selection
Each penny contributed equals one "share" in the selection pool.
Users cannot hold more than 50% of shares for any item to prevent dominance.
Random selection occurs using a transparent and verifiable method (e.g., Chainlink VRF or timestamp-seeded RNG).

Profit Redistribution
Monthly platform profits are calculated.
5% is distributed equally to all active verified users.
Another 5% is randomly awarded to selected users weighted by their activity/contributions.

Glitches (Reward Tokens)
Earned through purchases and sales of digital achievements or goods.
Usable to boost item visibility, unlock platform features, or increase contribution share limits.
Not purchasable with fiat, preventing gambling classification.

Community Jury System (Justice Layer)
Disputes trigger a jury randomly selected from the community.
Jury size scales with item price; voting outcomes determine penalties or rewards.
Jury members earn "Glorions," special tokens usable for perks or resale.

Glorions (Special Reward Tokens)
Earned primarily through jury participation and rare platform rewards.
Used for profile upgrades, item visibility boosts, or resale to sellers within the platform.

Technical Logic and Implementation Steps

Item Listing
Sellers list products with fixed prices.
System divides item price into shares where 1 share = $0.01.

Contribution Handling
Buyers contribute funds tracked with timestamp, user ID, and amount.
Each contribution assigned a numeric range proportional to its value.

Random Selection Logic
When total contributions equal item price, generate a random number in [1, total shares].
Determine winner whose share range includes this number.
Winner gains exclusive right to close the deal.

NPN Entry Logic
Users can submit entries without payment via verified tasks or forms.
Each NPN entry counts as one share in selection pool.

Profit Calculation and Distribution
Platform calculates monthly profit.
5% redistributed equally among active verified users.
Additional 5% randomly awarded based on contribution activity.

Reward Tokens (Glitches and Glorions)
Glitches earned via transactions; stored in user wallets and spent on perks.
Glorions rewarded for jury participation and verdict outcomes; usable for platform advantages.

Jury System
Initiated by user complaints.
Jury size scales with item price.
Members vote; system aggregates and applies penalties or rewards.
Jury members rewarded with Glorions based on verdict quality.

Legal & Fairness Controls
Max share limit per user at 50% to prevent manipulation.
RNG methods are transparent and verifiable.
All NPN entries logged for auditability.
